# Graphistry email

Graphistry optionally uses email for easy and secure account creation, invitations, and notifications. Many workflows switch to a more secure opt-in mode when email is enabled.

## Enable email

In `data/config/custom.env`, set:

```bash
DISABLE_EMAIL=false
```
## Configure email

Several options are possible, contact staff for host (smtp), mailgun, and debug
