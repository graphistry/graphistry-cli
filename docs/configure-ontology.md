# Configure Custom Graphistry Ontology

The Graphistry ontology is a set of mappings that guide automatic visualization and simplify data worklows. This document overviews the ontology and how to extend.

## Out-of-the-box ontologies

Graphistry supports out-of-the-box ontologies of common systems:

* Splunk CIM model
* ElasticSearch model
* Various vendor-specific models, such as FireEye HX/NX/iSIGHT and AWS CloudWatch

## The ontology's 4 mappings

The ontology defines:

* For each type, such as `user`:
  * Default icon: string name supported by [Font Awesome 4](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/), such as [user-o](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icon/user-o)
  * Default color: string hex value, such as `#F00` for red
  * Default size: number, typically between 10 and 200
  * Node/edge title: based on column name (`{titles: {byField: ["user", "id", "pointTitle", "edgeTitle"]}}`) or mapping of type-to-column-column (`{titles: {byType: {"geo": "city", "user": "name"}}}`) 
* New types:
For the automatic table -> graph transform (aka hypergraph transform), the mapping from _table column names_ to _node entity types_.
  
  
## How to extend the ontology

### Easiest: Ask Graphistry to do it for you! 

Ideally, you can provide representative sample data that has the columns and values of interest, and if a data schema is available, that too.

Ex: For Splunk users wanting support for a new product, provide the output of 
* `search index=some_product | fields * | dedup 20 event_type | head 1000`
* select all columns in the Field Selector
* download the CSV

### New types

For example, to create a new node type `ip`, 

1. Extend `data/investigations/config/config.json`:

```
{
  ...
  "ontology": {
      "icons": {
         "ip": "device",
         ...,
      },
      "colors": {
          "ip": "#F00",
          ...
      },
      "sizes": {
          "ip": 100
      }
   ...
}   
```

2. Restart the pivot service:

```user@server.com:/var/graphistry $ docker-compose stop pivot nginx && docker-compose up -d```

### Default node/edge titles

Graphistry picks the displayed title for each node and edge through the first match on the following cascade:

* By type match: Does the element's `type` value have a corresponding `byType` binding?
* By field match: Does the element contain a column name in `byField`?
* By `pointTitle` , `edgeTitle`, if available
* Use an element ID provided with the graph
* Use an element ID generated by the system

Ex:

```
{
  ...
  "ontology": {
      "titles": {
          "byType": {
              "geo": "address",
              "user": "name"
          },
          "byField": ["src_ip", "dest_ip"]
      }
  }
}
```


### New hypergraph transforms

The existing ontology may already have all the types you want, but a new data source may have columns that need to be mapped into it.

For example, to recognize `src_ip` and `dest_ip` columns as both generating `ip`-type nodes:

1. Extend `data/investigations/config/config.json`:

```
{
   ...
   "ontology": {
       "products": [
           {
               "name": "my_extension_1",
               "colTypes": {
                   "src_ip": "ip",
                    "dest_ip": "ip"
               }
           }
       ]
   }
}
```

2. Restart the pivot service:
```
user@server.com:/var/graphistry $ docker-compose stop pivot nginx && docker-compose up -d
```
         
         
## Testing your ontology

1. Syntax errors: 

Graphistry tries to detect syntax error, and upon one, logs the error and stops. To see what is going on:

`docker ps` <- see if `pivot` is unhealthy or in a restart loop
`docker-compose logs pivot` <- see the precise error message

2. Satisfactory configuration

We recommend creating a Manual Data pivot. For example, to test various `ip` columns, use the following:

* Query: `[ {"src_ip": "10.10.0.0", "dest_ip": "10.10.0.1", "ip": "10.10.0.2"} ]`
* JQ: `.`
* Nodes: `src_ip`, `dest_ip`, `ip`
