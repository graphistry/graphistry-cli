# Azure Marketplace Privacy Offer: Launching Graphistry Core BYOL

Graphistry enterprise users should check if they are eligible for private Azure Marketplace Graphistry Core Bring Your Own License (BYOL) plans. Under these, you are not double charged for Graphistry, just regular Azure hardware utilization fees.

Finding the right plan launch location can be tricky, so we provide a walkthrough below.

Upon launch, proceed with regular [Azure Marketplace (public) instructions](azure_marketplace.md). 

## Check the latest official Microsoft istructions

The steps are based on [Microsoft's offical instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/private-plans#deploying-a-private-plan)

## Ahead of time

* Ensure you have an Azure account

* [Get Azure GPU quota in the desired region](azure_marketplace.md#3-solve-gpu-availability-errors)

* Share your [Azure Subscription ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/media-services/latest/setup-azure-subscription-how-to?tabs=portal) with your Graphistry support agent

* Within 1 hour of sharing, and occasionally 4 days when a Azure Marketplace incident, your BYOL plan will be available for quicklaunches
