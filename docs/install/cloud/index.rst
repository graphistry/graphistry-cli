Quick launch: Managed
------------------------

See guides main guides in the navigation area

[AWS and Azure marketplaces](https://www.graphistry.com/get-started): The fastest way to start using Graphistry is to quick launch a preconfigured private Graphistry instance on [AWS and Azure marketplaces](https://www.graphistry.com/get-started)

It runs in your private cloud provider account and is configured to autostart. See [AWS launch walkthrough tutorial & videos](https://www.graphistry.com/blog/marketplace-tutorial) and linked guides for optional post-launch configuration and maintenance.

Out-of-the-box configurations include GPU drivers, Docker with Nvidia runtime, multi-GPU support, Graphistry installation, auto-start on instance stop/restart, and more
