A CLI for Managing a Graphistry Deployment
------------------------------------------

The Graphistry command-line interface supports installing, launching, and managing Graphistry. This document also walks through air-gapped deployment concerns such as environment bootstrapping and migrations.

``graphistry`` supports multiple commands:


* ``init`` Download, configure, and launch Graphistry
* ``compile`` Generate dist/graphistry.tar.gz
* ``compile_with_config`` Generate dist/graphistry.tar.gz and include local configuration
* ``config`` Configure Graphistry relative to latest Graphistry online baseline
* ``config_offline`` Configure Graphistry relative to offline baseline
* ``exit`` Leave application. Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D works too.
* ``keygen`` Create API key token
* ``help`` Shows all CLI commands
* ``launch`` Launch Graphistry based on local containers
* ``load`` Load Graphistry from Container Archive
* ``login`` Login to Graphistry
* ``pull`` Pull docker containers
* ``stop`` Stop All Graphistry Containers

Run non-interactive commands with ``-c``, such as ``graphistry -c stop``.

Quick Start
===========


Bootstrap: Download the CLI and setup your Linux environment
------------------------------------------------------------

**AWS**

* Launch an official AWS Ubuntu/RHEL/Centos AMI using a ``g3+``or ``p*`` GPU instance. 
* Use S3AllAccess permissions, and override default parameters for: 200GB RAM
* Enable SSH/HTTP/HTTPS in the security groups
* SSH as ``ubuntu@[your ami]``, ``centos@``, or ``ec2-user@``. 

Proceed to the OS-specific instructions below.

**Ubuntu 16.04**
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/graphistry/graphistry-cli.git
    $ bash graphistry-cli/bootstrap.sh ubuntu
```

**RHEL 7.4 / CentOS 7**
```
    $ sudo yum install -y git
    $ git clone https://github.com/graphistry/graphistry-cli.git 
    $ bash graphistry-cli/bootstrap.sh rhel
```

Log off and back in (full restart not required.)

Run
-----
```
    $ graphistry
```

* Press tab to see options
* Run ``init`` for streamlined initial configuration & launch
* See below for SSL setup, which we recommend for use with notebooks, embedding in web apps, and overall security.
* For subsequent use, run ``launch`` and ``stop``


Detailed Installation Instructions:

**Setup**

Continue to the Linux instructions below.


Linux (Non-Airgapped):
----------------------

Launch a GPU instance of Graphistry of either RHEL or Ubuntu. See the HW/SW document for recommended system specifications.

Log into your Graphistry server and install the CLI:


### Ubuntu

```
$ git clone https://github.com/graphistry/graphistry-cli.git && bash graphistry-cli/bootstrap.sh ubuntu
```

### RHEL/Centos7


```
$ sudo yum install -y git
$ git clone https://github.com/graphistry/graphistry-cli.git && bash graphistry-cli/bootstrap.sh rhel
```

Airgapped
---------


### Bootstrapping

The above scripts bootstrap the installation of Python3, Docker, CUDA, and Nvidia-Docker for various Linux distributions.
You can install those manually or use ``./bootstrap.sh <ubuntu/rhel>`` that is extracted to the root from your bundle.

The individual steps are broken out into their own scripts in the ``graphistry/bootstrap`` directory.

### Transfer, configure, & launch

1. If you do not have a large container file, generate it. Run ``graphistry`` and then: ``init``. After, ``compile``.

2. Move the container to the airgapped system, and bootstrap the system. (See scripts used above.)

3. Run ``graphistry`` and then: ``load``, ``config_offline``, and then ``launch``.


Installation:
-------------

1. The above commands will bootstrap your system and get the Graphistry cli ready. This will take a while.
2. After they complete, follow the instructions and run ``graphistry``
3. Now inside the Graphistry prompt, you can hit ``tab`` to see your options, but all you need to do to get Graphistry up and running is run the ``init`` command and answer the questions. Leave any blank that you are unsure about, and be ready to say which if you find launch issues.


Additional Commands and Configuration
======================


Setup SSL:
----------

If you have SSL certificates, we recommend installing them: this improves security and enables Graphistry to embed into tools that also use HTTPs.

1. Create folder `ssl/` as a sibling to `deploy`
2. Place files ``ssl_certificate.pem`` and ``ssl_certificate_key.pem`` into folder ``ssl/`` .
3. Restart Graphistry

Bundle a Deploy for Scanning and Air-Gapped Deployment:
--------------------------------------------------------

A full Graphistry deployment involves several systems:

* Bootstrapped environment (see above): Docker, Nvidia-Docker, Python3, ...
* Graphistry CLI (Python 3 wheel)
* Graphistry itself (Docker containers)
* Graphistry configuration (.config/* and *.json) <-- can be generated on the air-gapped system

The process is:
1. Download a tarball from Graphistry as a password-protected URL, or generated via the CLI on an internet-connected device
2. Setup the airgapped server: perform the above bootstrap processes and install the tarball
3. Reconfigure the Graphistry installation for the air-gapped server and launch it

**Generate a Tarball (Internet-connected)**

Either download a tarball from your Graphistry account, or generate one from scratch:

1. See the Linux bootstrapping section for setting up environment dependencies
2. Start the CLI: ``graphistry``
3. From the CLI, run:  ``init` and then ``compile``

You will now have a ``*.tar.gz`` that contains binaries (CLI + Graphistry). To include configurations, switch to ``compile_with_config`` in Step 3 above.

**Load a Tarball (Airgapped)**

From a bootstrapped environment (Docker, Python3, Nvidia-Docker, ... see above):

1. Decompress: ``tar -xvzf my_graphistry.tar.gz``
2. Start the CLI: ``graphistry``
3. From the CLI, run: ``load`` ; ``config_offline`` ; ``launch``

If the transferred file included sufficient system configurations, you can skip the ``config_offline`` step.


Upgrading:
==========

### Update to the latest CLI

The CLI is a standard Python3 program:

```
#Stop the Graphistry server if it is running
$graphistry -c stop

#Fetch the latest CLI
$cd graphistry-cli
$git pull

#Clean existing
$pip3 uninstall graphistry
$python3 setup.py clean
$pythpn3 setup.py install
```

### Update to the latest container: Internet connected

* Pull the latest settings: ``graphistry -c pull``
* From the CLI, run ``load`` ; ``config`` ; ``launch``


### Update to the latest container: Airgapped

* Copy the latest container to your system
* Stop Graphistry if it is running: ``graphistry -c stop``
* From the CLI, run ``load`` ; ``config`` ; ``launch``


Testing:
========

* Installation repositories are accessible:
  * ping www.github.com
  * ping shipyard.graphistry.com
  * ping us.gcr.io
* Configurations were generated: 
  * ``.config/graphistry/config.json``
  * ``httpd-config.json``
  * ``pivot-config.json``
  * ``viz-app-config.json``
* Services are running: ``docker ps`` reveals no restart loops on:
  * ``monolith-network-nginx``
  * ``monolith-network-pivot``
  * ``monolith-network-viz``
  * ``monolith-network-mongo``
  * ``monolith-network-db-bu``
  * ``monolith-network-pg``
* Services pass initial healthchecks:
  * ``site.com/central/healthcheck``
  * ``site.com/pivot/healthcheck``
  * ``site.com/worker/healthcheck``
* Pages load
  * ``site.com`` shows Graphistry homepage
  * ``site.com/graph/graph.html?dataset=Facebook`` clusters and renders a graph
  * ``site.com/pivot`` loads a list of investigations
  * ``site.com/pivot/connectors`` loads a list of connectors
  * ^^^ When clicking the ``Status`` button for each connector, it reports green
  *  Opening and running an investigation in ``site.com/pivot`` uploads and shows a graph
* Data uploads
  * Can generate an API key with the CLI: ``graphistry`` --> ``keygen``
  * Can use the key to upload a visualization: https://graphistry.github.io/docs/legacy/api/0.9.2/api.html#curlexample
  * Can then open that visualization in a browser



Troubleshooting:
================

Did you have issues with pulling containers and you know they are public? Sometimes `docker-py` gets confused if you have
old containers or are running out of space. Clear out your containers, do a `docker logout` in your terminal and then try again.

A special thanks to `Jonathan Slenders <https://twitter.com/jonathan_s>` for
creating `Python Prompt Toolkit <http://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit>`,
which is quite literally the backbone library, that made this app possible.
And the people who made `pgcli <https://github.com/dbcli/pgcli>` which I mostly wholesale copied to make this tool

`Click <http://click.pocoo.org/>` is used for command line option parsing and printing error messages.
