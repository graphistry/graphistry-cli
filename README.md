## Quick GPU Docker environment test

You can test your GPU environment via Graphistry's [base RAPIDS Docker image on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/graphistry/graphistry-forge-base):

```bash
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash graphistry/graphistry-forge-base:latest -c "source activate rapids && python3 -c \"import cudf; print(cudf.DataFrame({'x': [0,1,2]})['x'].sum())\""
```

=>
```
3
```

See the installation and debugging sections for additional scenarios such as ensuring Docker Compose is correctly defaulting to a GPU runtime.
